Switch to a different Astronomer installation. You can switch to a given Astronomer installation only if you have authenticated to it at least once using `astro login`. If you have not authenticated, run `astro login <base-domain>` instead.

Note that after switching to a different Astronomer installation, you might have to re-authenticate to the installation using `astro login`.  

## Usage

```sh
astro context switch <basedomain>
```
