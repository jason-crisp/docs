Delete an Astro Workspace. 

## Usage

```sh
astro workspace delete <workspace-id>
```

You can find a Workspace's ID by running `astro workspace list`, or by opening your Workspace and going to **Workspace Settings** > **General** in the Cloud UI. If you don't provide a Workspace ID, the CLI prompts you to pick from a list of Workspaces that you belong to in your current Organization.
